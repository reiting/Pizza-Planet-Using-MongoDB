# Lab 13: Pizza Planet - Part 1

#### Covalence

## Info

* You will be building a front-end and back-end for a space-themed pizza restaurant and arcade called Pizza Planet

* Your boss, The Claw, has chosen you

* You will be building a simple web page that shows a list of pizza planet locations

* The page will also have input boxes and a submit button for creating a new location

## Getting Started

* This is a NodeJS project, so we need a package.json file. Use npm init to create one

* Make sure you have a .gitignore file set to ignore the node_modules folder

* You will need to install the express, body-parser, and mongodb node modules. Make sure you use --save.

### Objectives - Database

* Data will be stored in a local MongoDB database named pizzaPlanet

* Locations will be stored in a collection called locations

* A pizza planet location needs to have the following information:

* name (i.e. "5 Points South") 
* delivers (true/false)
* phone
* address (an address consists of line1, line2, city, state, zip)

### Objectives - API

* Build an express server

* Should statically serve the client folder

* Should respond to requests on the collection URL for getting all locations, and creating a new location

* The collection URL should be /api/locations

### Objectives - Frontend

* Have an index.html in your client folder

* It should make request all the locations from the API when it first loads

* You can style the locations on screen however you'd like

* You may use Bootstrap if you wish

* Each location should show the name, whether or not it delivers, the phone number, and the complete address

* There should be a set of input fields at the top of the page for creating a new location

* Text box for location name

* Checkbox for delivers

* Tel box for phone

* Series of text and number boxes for all address fields, with maxlength="2" for state and 5 for zip

## Coming Up

* Don't worry about making detail pages

* We will come back and do that when we learn Angular (makes it much easier)

* If you want a head start, you can make the API endpoints for the detail URL for a single location

* Should support reading one, updating one, and deleting one location
